# melanoma-detection
This repo is attempt to make CNN model for multiclass classification and melanoma detection

# Observations/Learning
1. Following experiments were done

a) Adding More number of layers
b) Trials on optimizers
c) Using dropout
d) Adding L2 normalization

2. Observations
a) Adam provide good result with dropout 
b) Class imbalance in training data led to overfitting

3. Learning
a) Data Augmentation methodology
b) Impact of balancing class data to manage model performance during training and validation
